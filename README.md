The datasets must be inserted into a folder called data. Create the select_data, transform_data, and preprocess are created in the data folder.

# Dependencies
To be able to run these scripts the following Python 3 libraries are required:
 * sklean
 * Pandas
 * NumPy
 * SciPy
 * Keras
 * matplotlib

# Runing the scripts
Each of the scripts contains the code to tune and train each of the different models developed for this project. To run one of them, Python 3 interpreter must be called on them. For example:

python3 "Decision Trees.py"

# Note:
The ann.py file uses Tensorflow version 1
The rnn.py file uses Tensorflow version 2
